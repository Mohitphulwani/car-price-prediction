Predicting car prices using machine learning by analyzing automobile specifications such as horsepower, torque, drivetrain, fuel economy, body type, and engine features.
# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to **predict the price of a car** using available automobile data and analyze the relationship between price and car specifications.  

Potential buyers often want to understand how features like horsepower, transmission type, fuel economy, and drivetrain affect the price of a car. This project helps identify these relationships and provides a predictive model for automobile pricing.

## Objectives
- Analyze relationships between car specifications and price.  
- Identify which features most strongly impact automobile pricing.  
- Build a predictive model to estimate car prices using machine learning.

## Features & Methodology
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Handle missing values, standardize units, encode categorical variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Visualize relationships between price and key features (e.g., horsepower, torque, fuel economy).  
- **Modeling**  
  - Predictive modeling using **Ridge Regression, Linear Regression, or other regression techniques**.  
- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Metrics: RÂ², RMSE, MAE  
- **Insights**  
  - Identify features with the most influence on price.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for predictive modeling  
- **Plotly / Dash (optional)** for interactive dashboards
